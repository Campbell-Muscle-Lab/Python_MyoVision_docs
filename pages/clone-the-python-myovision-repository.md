Everything to do with Python-MyoVision (the source code, this tutorial, example images, etc.) are stored in a type of database called a Git Repository. The database is updated each time a developer makes a change. The most recent version of the database is stored online at [Python_MyoVision](https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/Python_MyoVision).

The GitHub Desktop client allows you to "clone" the repository to your own computer, so that you can keep up to date with the latest changes.

### Instructions

+ Make a directory on your computer where you want to keep your repository.
  + This documentation assumes that you are using `c:\users\your_user_name\github\Python_MyoVision`
+ Now follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) to clone [the repository](
https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/Python_MyoVision) to your local directory.
+ Now open your local directory.
  + You should see a folder structure that looks like this.

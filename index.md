description: Web-based help for Python_MyoVision
---

These pages provide information about an implementation of the MyoVision software package written in Python.

The basic approach is very similar to that described by [Wen et al. (2018)](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00762.2017) but the software has been re-written in an attempt to make it more robust and potentially faster.
